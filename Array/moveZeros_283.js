// Move Zeros. LC 283

/*

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining t
he relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

From the hint:

"A two-pointer approach could be helpful here. 
The idea would be to have one pointer for iterating the array and 
another pointer that just works on the non-zero elements of the array.""

* @param {number[]} nums
* @return {void} Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
