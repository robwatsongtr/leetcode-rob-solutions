// LC 944 Delete Columns to Make Sorted

/*
You are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length.
The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid.
For example, strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"] can be arranged as follows:

abc
bce
cae

the third group, cae, is not lexigraphically sorted so you return 1

Return the number of columns that you will delete.
